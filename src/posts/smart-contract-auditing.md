The overlap between offensive security and smart contract auditing is bigger than you think. If you can find vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs, you already have most of the mental models you need for DeFi security.

## Why red teamers should care

Smart contracts are immutable code that controls real money. The attack surface includes reentrancy, integer overflow, access control flaws, and oracle manipulation — many of which have direct analogs in traditional application security.

## Getting started with Solidity

You don't need to become a blockchain developer. You need to understand Solidity well enough to read contracts and spot common vulnerability patterns. Start with the Damn Vulnerable DeFi challenges — they're the Hack The Box of smart contract security.

## The tooling

Slither for static analysis, Foundry for testing, and a good understanding of the EVM are your starting kit. If you already know Python, Brownie is a natural bridge into smart contract interaction.

More details coming soon — this is a placeholder post.
